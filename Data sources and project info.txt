Data sources:
Kaggle:
    https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries/version/1

Data World:
    https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/college-majors/workspace/file?filename=recent-grads.csv
    https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors

The goal is to combine these two tables to compare the amount of recent grads (2010-2012) noted from Data World
and compare that information to the Kaggle salary information from 2017. We found that these two data sets are 
close enough in recency where we would be able to compare how many recent grads are projected to make a certain 
median amount early in their careers and later in their careers according to Kaggle. These data sets are joined 
on major and majors not shared between the data sets are dropped along with null values.
